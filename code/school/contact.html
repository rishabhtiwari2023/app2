<td colspan="2" ><h2 align="center">Delhi Public School Cricket</h2><p>TIt was a rather unequal contest between the students of Delhi Public School North Kolkata and the players of the Kalyani Spandan Club in Kalyani. The team of our school was not only equipped with the regular cricket equipment but also with a zeal to win and take over the championsâ€™ title. I scored 43 runs. Divyesh Gupta took 3 wickets and Riddhiman took 2 wickets. We scored 95 runs in 17.5 overs. The score of Kalyani Spandan Club was 89 in 20 overs. This was a fabulous victory of our school team and we all rejoiced at it. </p>
